<h1> Supercut </h1>

<h2> Lorde </h2>

<p>
In my head, I play a supercut of us<br>
All the magic we gave off<br>
All the love we had and lost<br>
And in my head<br>
The visions never stop<br>
These ribbons wrap me up<br>
But when I reach for you<br>
There's just a supercut<br>
</p>

<p>
In your car, the radio up<br>
In your car, the radio up<br>
We keep trying to talk about us<br>
I'm someone you maybe might love<br>
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush<br>
Be your violent overnight rush<br>
Make you crazy over my touch<br>
</p>

<p>
But it's just a supercut of us<br>
Supercut of us<br>
Oh it's just a supercut of us<br>
Supercut of us<br>
</p>

<p>
So I fall<br>
Into continents and cars<br>
All the stages and the stars<br>
I turn all of it<br>
To just a supercut<br>
</p>

<p>
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)<br>
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)<br>
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)<br>
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh <br>
</p>

<p>
In your car, the radio up <br>
In your car, the radio up <br>
We keep trying to talk about us <br>
Slow motion, I'm watching our love <br>
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush <br>
Be your violent overnight rush <br>
Make you crazy over my touch <br>
</p>

<p>
But it's just a supercut of us <br>
Supercut of us <br>
Oh it's just a supercut of us <br>
Supercut of us <br>
But it's just a supercut of us <br>
Supercut of us <br>
Oh it's just a supercut of us <br>
Supercut of us <br>
</p>

<p>
Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right <br>
When you call I'll forgive and not fight <br>
All the moments I play in the dark <br>
Wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart <br>
</p>

<p>
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right) <br>
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight) <br>
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark) <br>
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart <br>
Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right) <br>
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight) <br>
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark) <br>
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart <br>
</p>

<p>
In my head, I do everything right <br>
In my head, I do everything right <br>
</p>
